# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Image Recognition

## Description

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image recognition. The model is trained on a dataset of images and is capable of recognizing new images outside the training set. The project also includes a thorough evaluation of the model's performance, including dataset splitting, confusion matrix, hyperparameter tuning, and visualizations of the model results. Additionally, the repository includes a comparison with other CNN structures and visualizations of feature maps.

## Must-Have Features

- **CNN Model**: A convolutional neural network trained on the dataset for image recognition and able to predict unseen images.
- **Model Evaluation**: The dataset is properly split for training and testing. Model performance is evaluated using a confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and other relevant metrics.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Proper tuning of model hyperparameters (such as learning rate, number of layers, batch size) for optimized performance.
- **Model Visualizations**: Visualizations of the model's predictions and evaluation results (e.g., confusion matrix, accuracy/loss graphs) with clear labels and titles.

## Nice-to-Have Features

- **Feature Map Visualization**: Visualizations of the feature maps generated by the model to understand how the CNN extracts features from the input images.
- **Comparison with Other Models**: A comparison of the results from the implemented CNN with other model architectures (e.g., LeNet, AlexNet, ResNet) to determine the most effective structure for the task.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.x and the following libraries installed:

- `tensorflow` for the deep learning model.
- `numpy` for numerical operations.
- `matplotlib` for plotting graphs and visualizations.
- `scikit-learn` for metrics and confusion matrix.
- `pandas` for data handling.

You can install the required packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib scikit-learn pandas
```
